# Starlink Internet Service Quality of Experience Predictions

AIM: When a nomadic user (ex; Camper with RV) likes to reach internet sometimes mobile cellular radio access solutions may not be feasible (no-coverage, bad price/performance), instead satellite internet access can be a good alternative. As Starlink becoming more robust by means of coverage and connection speeds, the quality of experience still varios per geo-location due to altitude, number satellites being visible, impact of weather, satellite line of sight obstruction etc. For a traveler to be aware of the quality of internet service on Starlink, we have trained a neural network transformer model to predict QoE. <br>
